## Work Day Scheduler Challenge

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

* When a time block is clicked an event can be entered.
* Each event is added at each hour and saved.
* Then texted saved is saved in local storage.
* Once event is saved it will remain on scheduler when page is refreshed.
* Events will be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.


## Built With
* HTML
* CSS powered by jQuery
* Javascript


## Has Responsiveness for:

* Small devices (mobile phones, 576px and up)
* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)


## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the https://momentjs.com/. (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/ (Links to an external site.)
